My name is Max Melnichenko and I am a 2nd year CS Ph.D student (although in my first year, I was a math Ph.D student). 
I recieved BS degrees in applied mathematics and computer science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania in
May of 2016. Currently, am a graduate research assistant at ICL (Dr. Jack Dongarra's lab) linear algebra group. 
My specialization and main interest is the filed of Randomized Numeriacl Linear Algebra (RNLA). 

Current project: as a part of BALLISTIC project, working on "Templates for Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra" book,
as well as "RandLAPACK" (name not finalized yet) project. The former is aiming to serve as both an educational resouce, and
a type of "cheat sheet" with a degree of useful advise for individuals interested in the field. The later represents a serious
C++ high performance linear algebra library of RNLA algorithms.
