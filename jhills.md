I am a last year graduate student in EECS getting my masters in Computer Science. My previous career was in physics/health physics, but decided to come back to school for a career change. As such, my primary career interests are software engineering and security (and whatever else will make me "industry-ready"). For hobbies, I like to spend most of my free time building my computer game which should not only compliment my career related skills (namely, software engineering as it is a very large game), but also give me something to do until I die of old age ;)
