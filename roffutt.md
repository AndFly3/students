My name is Rachel Offutt and I am a PhD student under Dr. Lanngston and a TA for his lab. My interest lies in graph theory and applying 
graph alorgithms to medical data - specifically end stage Renal Kidney Disease (ESRKD). My research involves identifying clinical characteristics, 
describing taxomomic structure, and identifying potential drugs for specialized treatment. I would like to cover a paper involving graphs or graph embeddings.
